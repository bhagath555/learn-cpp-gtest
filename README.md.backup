# learn cpp gtest
 VS code setup for unittesting cpp code via gtest, also this repository contains a simple code with unittest to let you start with your cpp unittsting. The whole process is automated with Cmake. Unlike other programming languages, CPP leanring curve is steeper and setting up project develpment environment (Suitable Compiler, automating building, testing, documenting, etc...) is even more complex task get it right in first attempt. So before starting with any of the coding part, I would like to describe my CPP project development environment. I am using WINDOWS 10 OS, and this setup process helps you. Otherwise please any other resource for your project setup.
 
 
 ## Pre configuration:
* **OS**	:	WINDOWS 10
* **VSCODE**	: Code Editor developed by MicroSoft. [VS code download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* **MSYS MinGW**	: 'MSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows software.'
* **CMake**	: Scripting language that automates the C/C++ project building procedure and many more.

	

## Setting up:
Now, to install C++ compiler MinGW via MSYS and C/C++ extension in VSCode, VScode official website contained instructions to follow  [VSC setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw). But, this is not an entire setup for our requirement, there are few more installation/configuration procedures to follow. Inord
